# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 5th, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Learnt how to fork an existing repository and begin this challenge

**Thoughts:** First dabbled in Github probably over 10 years ago, its been fun learning all the commands again and working out its usability. I'm looking forward to logging my progress to come back and review it again in 100 days..

### Day 1: January 5th, 2024

**Today's Progress:** First real entry, added some new content and features to my personal portfolio page using HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:** basic functionality such as social media links in my contact me footer, but also had some issues with flex-box whilst setting up a grid for project examples

**Link to work:** [github repo](https://github.com/george-bacon/george-bacon.github.io/commit/f9eb32c52ff74f06e12fea397b779750b235f460)

---

### Day 2: January 6th, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Quick update as time limited, fixed the flex box issue i was having (flex-box: flex should be flex-box: wrap), updated my contact link to focus at the footer for the time being (social media links) and amended some basic bits like text-transform: lowercase to gramatically correct the actual code.

**Thoughts:** Try and make some time up tomorrow for todays short burst of code. will top up this evening with Codecademy Pro ios app concept practice

### Day 3: January 7th, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Learnt about Markdown language on Codecademy and syntax before continuing with my personal project site. The site is part of Codecademy Pro continued learning and next steps are to create a new contact page and being to incorporate some JavaScript to my site (something I am yet to do)

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to the challenge of inserting JS into HTML, have some ideas of what I want to do; including re-working my project grid or setting up a form for a contact page.

### Day 4: January 8th, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Limited progress today as data issues on the day job meant time was taken up considerably. Ran through some Codecademy concept practice and played around with ChatGPT , got an idea of how to setup my JS implementations on portfolio in coming days

**Thoughts:** Continue the concept practice, 8 days streak on Codecademy. Continue to brush up on JS. Begin the delve back into React in the next week..

---

### Day 5: January 9th, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Added first implementation of JS into my portfolio - prepending and appending text to my h2 element to simulate code. Additionally, added some transform CSS to my icons to visually show being hovered over.

**Thoughts:** Getting where I want to be with the portfolio, will look to create a form in coming days and then crack on with JS study.

### Day 6: January 10th, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Learnt about classes in JavaScript and used them on Codecademy to  create a couple of mini projects using Media and Schools. Learnt about inheritance and cemented some further knowledge and understanding of getters and setters.

**Thoughts:** Struggling for time when having to travel to London for the day job! Continuing to utilise the Codecademy app to keep knowledge fresh.

---

### Day 7: January 11th, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Started learning about modules in JavaScript. Quite brief after doing some more Class work earlier in the day but modules seem to be a bit tricky to get my head around currently.. maybe just tired..

**Thoughts:** Had started to feel like I was making great progress with programming these last few days but struggling to get my head around all the importing/exporting particularly the use of default. Tackle the rest of it with a fresh head tomorrow..

**Link to work:** No repo or commits to share today

---

### Day 8: January 12, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Continued the Codecademy syllabus and recapped on Class use and learnt about error handling.

**Thoughts:** Error handling is a bit like yesterday's module concept, need to look at these in further detail

**Link to work:** No repo or commits to share today

### Day 9: January 18, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Few days out with social arrangements on so got back into the swing of things today. Loaded up Codecademy's class challenges and got through the first 2 before getting stuck on the 'Shift Cypher'. Carried on to the next challenge which is building a game within the terminal. Learnt about prompts - something that has intrigued me since beginning in JavaScipt: how does the user interact or push their own dynamic input. Tick!

**Thoughts:** Frustrating to be stumped by the shift cypher, will definitely come back to this. Struggling with some of the game concept, pick up and progress tomorrow..

### Day 10: January 19, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Finished off the first iteration of the terminal game. Added feature such as score, out of bounds check, check if hole and obviously check if player found the hat. 

**Thoughts:** Keen to progress on with Codecademy's Front End career path. Next up is Testing

**Link to work:** [git commit](https://github.com/george-bacon/pro_js_projects/commit/0d27bf08d04c71ff15169e1e49f7d70b59c039a0)

### Day 11: January 20, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Began a dive into testing , focused on TDD (Test Driven Development) and used the 'assert' functionality in node.js to run my own tests against Codecademy's project. Learnt about MochaJS and did some basic programming to help solidify some concepts and pass tests. 

**Thoughts:** Enjoyable module, looking forward to doing more test cases. Opened my eyes to another segment of day to day programming in the real world. Looking forward to doing some of the challenges on the Codecadmey Pro course.

**Link to work:** No repo or commits to share as worked on the interactive codecademy space. Links to [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Assert in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html)
