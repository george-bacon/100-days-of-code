# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 5th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learnt how to fork an existing repository and begin this challenge

**Thoughts:** First dabbled in Github probably over 10 years ago, its been fun learning all the commands again and working out its usability. I'm looking forward to logging my progress to come back and review it again in 100 days..

### Day 1: January 5th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: First real entry, added some new content and features to my personal portfolio page using HTML and CSS

**Thoughts**: basic functionality such as social media links in my contact me footer, but also had some issues with flex-box whilst setting up a grid for project examples

### Day 2: January 6th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Quick update as time limited, fixed the flex box issue i was having (flex-box: flex should be flex-box: wrap), updated my contact link to focus at the footer for the time being (social media links) and amended some basic bits like text-transform: lowercase to gramatically correct the actual code.

**Thoughts**: Try and make some time up tomorrow for todays short burst of code. will top up this evening with Codecademy Pro ios app concept practice

### Day 3: January 7th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Markdown language on Codecademy and syntax before continuing with my personal project site. The site is part of Codecademy Pro continued learning and next steps are to create a new contact page and being to incorporate some JavaScript to my site (something I am yet to do)

**Thoughts**: Looking forward to the challenge of inserting JS into HTML, have some ideas of what I want to do; including re-working my project grid or setting up a form for a contact page.
